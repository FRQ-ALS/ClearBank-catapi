# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you get an error that says "Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json", please ignore and hit the X in the top right. The app should still work fine.



In the terminal, you can run:
### `git clone https://github.com/FRQ-ALS/ClearBank-catapi.git`
### `cd ClearBank-catapi`
### `npm i`

### `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
